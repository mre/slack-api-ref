### Slack

This project is not affiliated with the [company that makes Slack](https://slack.com). We began by forking JSON schema files from [slackhq/slack-api-docs](https://github.com/slackhq/slack-api-docs), then updating the schema from the documentation at [api.slack.com](https://api.slack.com) to, finally, relying on a scraper.
