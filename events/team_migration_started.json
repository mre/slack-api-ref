The websocket connection will close immediately after it is sent. Occasionally we need to move Slack teams to a new server. To avoid any data synchronization bugs or race conditions we disconnect all clients from a team before starting this process. By the time a client has reconnected the process is usually complete, so the impact is minimal. When clients receive this event, immediately start a reconnection process by calling rtm.start again. You may receive occasional migration_in_progress errors when re-calling rtm.start. If this happens you should wait a few seconds and try again. If the error continues you should wait longer before retrying, and so on.",
