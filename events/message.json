The user property is the ID of the user speaking, the text property is the text spoken, and ts is the unique (per-channel) timestamp. Messages can also include an attachments property, containing a list of attachment objects. If the message has been edited after posting it will include an edited property, including the user ID of the editor, and the timestamp the edit happened. The original text of the message is not available. For example: Unlike other event types, message events can have a subtype. For example, this is a channel join message: They are structured in this way so that clients can either support them fully by having distinct behavior for each different subtype, or can fallback to a simple mode by just displaying the text of the message. The full list of message subtypes is: A message was posted by an integration A channel was archived A team member joined a channel A team member left a channel A channel was renamed A channel purpose was updated A channel topic was updated A channel was unarchived A comment was added to a file A file was mentioned in a channel A file was shared into a channel A group was archived A team member joined a group A team member left a group A group was renamed A group purpose was updated A group topic was updated A group was unarchived A /me message was sent A message was changed A message was deleted A message thread received a reply An item was pinned in a channel A message thread's reply was broadcast to a channel An item was unpinned from a channel Some subtypes have a special hidden property. These indicate messages that are part of the history of a channel but should not be displayed to users. Examples include records of message edits or deletes: Hidden messages are only sent over the Real Time Messaging API. They will not appear as the latest property on channel, group or im objects. They will also not be returned in calls to channels.history, im.history or groups.history. Messages can have several extra properties depending on whether or not they have been starred, pinned, or reacted to: The is_starred property is present and true if the calling user has starred the message, else it is omitted. The pinned_to array, if present, contains the IDs of any channels to which the message is currently pinned. The reactions property, if present, contains any reactions that have been added to the message and gives information about the type of reaction, the total number of users who added that reaction and a (possibly incomplete) list of users who have added that reaction to the message. The users array in the reactions property might not always contain all users that have reacted (we limit it to X users, and X might change), however count will always represent the count of all users who made that reaction (i.e. it may be greater than users.length). If the authenticated user has a given reaction then they are guaranteed to appear in the users array, regardless of whether count is greater than users.length or not. This exact event type is defined differently in the Events API. Depending on your associated OAuth scope or the channels your bot user belongs to, you must subscribe to one of the following events instead: The semantics for the events are the same as those described here â€” you're still receiving an event of type message. Not all message subtypes are deliverable in the Events API.",
